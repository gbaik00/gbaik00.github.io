I began playing golf from a very young age as it was a sport that intrigued me as a child. Playing the sport not only kept me in shape and got me out of the house, but it also taught me honesty. Golf, like many sports, can be viewed as a game of honesty, as it is an independent sport where the smallest differences can help you, and in a large sport like golf, the temptation to take the easy path while no one is paying attention hangs over every player. Through this system I taught myself to never follow that temptation after seeing many take it and get caught.

Playing competitively not only in High School, but also for independent organizations gave me a lot of experience in being able to handle myself in difficult and stressful situations. This ties into programming, as there are many times where you are expected to create an program in a time period you may or may not be able to finish it in, such as the ICS314 WODs. Through golf I learned to never panic when faced with a difficult problem, and learned to tackle my problems in smart ways rather than head-on, even if it means I have to take a step back to see the bigger picture, something I believe will be crucial in my endeavor to become a Video Game Developer.
