Prior to working at Intelleyou Learning Center I was a student going there needing help with Pre-Calculus work from High School. It was 
thanks to their efforts that I was able to do as well as I had in the class, and was given the opportunity from the head tutor (shown in 
picture above) to help them with tutoring, since he felt as though that I was competent enough at enough subjects and had done well enough 
on the SAT to teach effectively.

Although most may not consider their job to be a project, I felt as though that teaching K-12 students was too important to treat as "just a job". I want to make sure that the students understood what I taught and left the tutoring center with a better understanding of what they didn't understand. Looking back at the public school system I feel as though there were many topics, specifically in math, where they hand you the material or the formulas without prior explanation. They just tell you to use the formula they give you without question, which I think is a very poor way of preparing students not only for the next level of Math, or whatever class it is they may take, but also for standardized tests for the SAT and the ACT. I view working at Intelleyou not just as a job, but also as a project. Specifically, a project where my goal is to help as many Hawaii youth as I can succeed in their academics.

Working as a tutor ties into Computer Programming since, as a tutor I need to be able to tackle and see problems in different ways to ensure that if my students do not quite understand one method of thinking, I have many more method's of thinking that could possibly help them. Having these different perspectives and ways of thinking can help me as a programmer as sometimes one way of thinking isn't enough to solve a problem or create a program.
