summary: A sidescrolling game I collaborated with a friend with in ICS111
---

ICS111 was my first class that I had to learn coding for. Unfortunately I had not taken advantage of the STEM electives that my high school provided, so I went into Computer Science with virtually no prior knowledge of how to code. I had an exceptionally hard time compared to others in the class due to this, however I managed to study hard and learn enough to create this game with a friend of mine, Justin Wong, for our final project.

Looking back the code itself is very rough, but considering where I had started from when I first took that class and where I got to with this project, I find a feeling of accomplishment regardless of how rough the game may look. The game included features such as a scoring system, along with a high score system that records the highest score achieved by the player, a health system that doesn't just deplete but also can regenerate depending on the projectiles you end up colliding with, and so on. 

Doing this project not only taught me how fun programming games can be, but also how to tackle larger projects like this along with how to properly communicate with the person/people that I work with.
