## My Experience with Software Engineering, and Why I am Interested in it.
Software engineering is something I don't have much experience with now, and was something I didn't even remotely understand since two semesters ago. You might ask why I became so intrigued with creating programs and algorithms after my first semester doing business-related classes, and it is a fairly simple reason. I enjoy video games. The reason why I hadn't started earlier was mostly because I was afraid of the math and science that came with being a Computer Science major, however after trying out my second choice in terms of major, that was Business, I figured I would give it a shot. So far I do not regret my decision, nor do I look to anytime soon.

## My Passion and How Software Engineering Will Help Me Follow it.
Ever since I laid my eyes upon my first video gaming consoles I fell in love. There was only one thing that I had consistently done everyday along side practicing golf, and that was playing video games. Not only did I find a lot of enjoyment playing them, but I found it fascinating how you could play such a complex program with such a small disk/cartridge. This fascination and passion for video games is what sparked my interest after I decided that Business was not for me, and the best way I felt I could follow my passion was to learn Software Engineering through Computer Science. 

## What I Expect to Learn in the Future
Although ICS111 is the only experience so far I have had in Computer Science where I created a video game, I hope to learn in the future a robust coding language that I can master in order to create an indie game of my own. Working for a video game development company of course is the goal in the end, however I hope that before I apply for my dream companies that I take a stab at creating a game of my own using my own imagination.
