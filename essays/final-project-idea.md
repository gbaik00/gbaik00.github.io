1. Overview

  College is widely viewed in the United States to be very expensive. With costs such as tuition, room & board, books, and so on, 
  college often costs tens of thousands of dollars, causing many to have to dip into loans and collect debt. While a simple programmer
  going to such a college I can't solve all of these problems, what we all can agree on is that any amount of money that can be saved 
  must be saved. Although I can't exactly cause things like room & board or tuition to go down, what my program proposes to do to help 
  students save some money is to create a cheap food finder for the campus. Food from restaurants on campus are generally quite 
  expensive, but there are some menu items that some students may find to be good/filling for the price it is sold for. The program 
  will collect menu items from various restaurants across campus with the help of students who use the app, and will compile them into 
  a big list that anyone can look at and determine for themselves if it could be worth it. 

2. Mockup page ideas

  Users will be the students who will be using the app, and their purpose would be to input what food items they find. Although our
  mission is to help students find cheap meals, the meals themselves do not have to qualify. This app will also help students discover
  the types of restaurants that exist on campus as well, without having to walk around every nook and cranny in the campus. For example,
  If someone is having a craving for crepes but don't know that there is a crepe restaurant over in Paradise Palms, then by checking 
  the app they will learn that their craving is satisfiable on campus. 
  
  Admins on the other hand will ensure that food items that are inputted by the users are actual meals, and not just bags of chips
  or bottles of water. They will look at data sent in by users and determine if it is a real menu item that exists on campus. There
  will also be a page that displays the cheapest menu items that exist on campus, which helps our students find somewhere to eat without
  too much worry as to breaking their wallet.

3. Use case ideas

Users go to the Landing Page where they can create an account at the Create Account Page, or log in if they already have an account.
They then are at the Home Page, where they can edit settings, see the full item page, cheapest foods page, or the option to add an item.
If an item is requested by a user to be added, the admins will log in with their admin accounts on the Landing Page, where they can
approve of or disapprove of any requests users have sent in.

4. Beyond the basics

Users can react to any menu items added. Opinions on foods vary, so to have a like/dislike function will help students determine if
they are willing to try out any of the menu items on the list. If people aren't satisfied with just looking at a like/dislike function
and want more information, users can also submit a review on specific items, which will also have a like/dislike function attached to 
it, to help weed out any biased or troll reviews. On top of the cheapest menu items being displayed on the Cheapest Foods Page, 
the foods with the most reviews will appear as well, along with possibly some admin's choices, and the items with the best like/dislike
ratio, with a minimum review amount, so as to make sure an item with 1 like/0 dislikes will not appear.
